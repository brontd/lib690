## 3.2: Using the Nano Text Editor

It has been some time since I last used the Nano text editor. It's a very convenient and effective editor with a fairly short learning curve to basic usage.

This makes it perfect for editing text-based configuration files, but I have grown to prefer Vim (which at one point I never really considered possible).
Unlike Nano or GUI-based text editors, Vim *is not* modeless. It enables a number of modes:

- Normal -- e.g., moving about in the file, deleting lines, copy/paste texts, etc.
- Insert -- data entry, etc.
- Visual -- enables mouse selections, etc.
- Command -- Search with regular expressions, etc. 

And though this presents a challenge (that of a blank screen with no user prompts), Vim offers a host of tools, functionality, and mouse-less focus on the CLI keyboard that System Administrators as well as Software Developers value.

The following is a far-cry from the neat menu options that Nano provides. Vim is not exactly easy (and I've printed and posted cheat sheets many times), but I've also never encountered an issue, even viewing enormous files, that was beyond it's capacity.

That said, I will leave with an quip from the AskUbuntu Forum:

"I've been using vim for about 2 years now, mostly because I can't figure out how to exit it."
