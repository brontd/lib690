[Git Cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

[Rename a file in Git](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/renaming-a-file)

I have some basic familiarity with Git. We use it for library projects here at UK, but I have much to learn. To be honest I feel the same way about Git as I do the remote control to my stereo receiver... so many buttons, but I only use the on/off and volume control... ;-)
