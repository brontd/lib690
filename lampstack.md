# LAMP Stack

I have been working, with some variations, on LAMP stacks for a number of years. This was a great tutorial. I don't think I have ever found a more succinct and clear set up for all the components. Very easy to follow instructions (with working code).

Over the years, I have come to appreciate MySQL, but I prefer Postgres (better use of schemas and no `tick` marks around everything.
