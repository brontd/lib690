### Cat vs BatCat  
As a fairly frequent user of *cat* to have a quick look inside of various file, I can see how this could be an improvement, especially w/r/t screen readability.

## 3:5: Library Search 

Very interesting to learn about [Yaz](https://www.indexdata.com/resources/software/yaz/). I have worked with Alma (mostly via XML), but the [Z39.50 Standard](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/) is an entirely new entity for me. The [Z39.50](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/resources/software.html) is around 50 years old. It is fascinating to explore early technological incarnations, if only as a reminder that these sorts of systems are *always* in a state of flux and destined inevitably for abandonment. There remains, however, hints of a continuum. For instance, the Z39.50 protocol spawned a language, [Contextual Query Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_Query_Language) that seems very likely to have had an influence on the development of a more familiar current technology, [Structured Query Language or SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), which underpins an enormous number of web sites, financial transactions, etc. today.

It is also of interest to note that the Alma server from which this data, about Jorge Luis Borges, was pulled is named *ALEPH,* which is the title of one of his most famous stories. And there are, in fact, those who argue that Borges, though not in a literal sense, created the Internet...
