### Cat vs BatCat  
As a fairly frequent user of *cat* to have a quick look inside of various file, I can see how this could be an improvement, especially w/r/t screen readability.

## 3:5: Library Search 

Very interesting to learn about [Yaz](https://www.indexdata.com/resources/software/yaz/). I have worked with Alma (mostly via XML), but the [Z39.50 Standard](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/) is an entirely new entity for me. The [(Z39.50](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/resources/software.html) is around 50 years old. It is fascinating to explore early technological incarnations, if only as a reminder that these sorts of systems are *always* in a state of flux and destined inevitably for abandonment, but once percieves hints of a continuum. For instance, the Z39.50 protocol spawned a language, [Contextual Query Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_Query_Language) that seems very likely to have had an influence on the development of a more current technology, [Structured Query Language or SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), which underpins an enormous number of web sites, financial transactions, etc. today.
